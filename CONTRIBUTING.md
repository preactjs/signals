# Contributing

## Contribution guidelines

We recognize that LLM's have become an integral tool for many users, however when using LLMs to help write issues or pull requests, disclose this. Transparency preserves the collaborative integrity that makes open-source communities work. It's the difference between "I used AI to help structure this bug report" (honest, helpful) and silently passing off generated content as your own analysis (deceptive, counterproductive). We as maintainers want to engage with humans rather than LLM-generated messages, put time in your issue report and that will be reflected back.

## Releasing Signals (Maintainers only)

This guide is intended for core team members that have the necessary rights to merge pull requests to the `main` branch.

To create a new release, merge "Version Packages" PR opened by the changesets-action. The release workflow will automatically create new releases for the packages that have changesets.
